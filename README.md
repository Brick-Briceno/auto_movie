# Auto Movie

This is a software that provides an interface that adapts to each resolution by adapting it in a 1:1 ratio

It has line wrapping so that the words do not go off the screen

To create new templates, just access `templates.py` and add all the ones you want

## Tutorial

### Install moviepy and Pillow:
go to cmd or preferably powershell and type

```bash
pip install moviepy
pip install pillow
```

If you get any error update pip with "pip install --upgrade pip"

And download Visual C++ Build Tools https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?q=build+tools

### how to use it?
just access the `example.py` file and put the text and the template number with which you want to convert the videos

```python
from auto_movie import Video_n_Text

#define the template text and number
text = "Hi, how are you! âœ¨"
Video_n_Text.create_videos(text=text, template_number=5)
```

You can edit or add more templates in the `templates.py` file, just modify the metadata in the dictionary (template) you want

The files will be saved in the output folder, if the folder does not exist it will be created
